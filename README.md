# PgxSAVy
PgxSAVy is a tool for quality control and annotation of variant peptides identified in proteogenomics. It has demonstrated excellent performance across a wide range of datasets. PgxSAVy is suitable for rescoring variant proteogenomics search results as well as evaluating the quality of variant peptides identified in proteogenomics. PgxSAVy is available as a standalone tool. 

## Features
### SAV quality checks from pgx searches
### Match quality checks
### Global search parameters (like Search engine counts , if multiple search tools used) and Number of sibling PSMs
### Isobaric checks with opther amino acids
### Checks with wild type peptide quality
### Checks with positional variant decoys

PgxSAVy is implemented in the cross-platform Perl programming language and can be used on computers running Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. PgxSAVy is freely available for academic use.

PgxSAVy can read inputs and write outouts in tab seperated text formats, making it easy to use. See the [complete documentation](https://github.com/anuragraj/PgxSAVy/wiki), including a list of [Frequently Asked Questions](). Example sample files can be found [here]().
